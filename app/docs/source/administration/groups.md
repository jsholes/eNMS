Easily synonymous with teams, `Groups` are a collection of users. `Groups` define which pages
 and actions a team can take (`Menu and Endpoint Access`); they also define default access for user created objects 
 (`Default Model Access`) and define the type of access along with the specific devices they may use 
 (`Device RBAC Setup`). RBAC is an acronym for Role Based Access Control.

<h4>Main Properties</h4> 

![Main Properties](../_static/administration/groups_main.png)

* **Name**: Unique identification for team name
* **Creator**: Auto Populated field based on the user who built the team
* **Description**: Text field for storing notes  
* **Email**: Team email address
* **Admin Only**: An override of `Access Control`, which prevents non-admin users from viewing or editing this object.  
* **Always set 'Read' access**: An override of `Access Control`, which will make this team always have read level 
  access to all services. This is helpful for admin like `Groups` to be able to support other `Groups` help requests, 
  by always granting view access.  
* **Users**: Members of this team

<h4>Menu and Endpoint Access</h4> 
Fine control of actions a team can take.

!!! Advice
    Each device can be operated on individually to update the RBAC settings. However, the top menu bar for `Groups` 
    has an icon that will `Update Device RBAC from Pools`. This feature uses the settings defined in `Device RBAC Setup`
    and pushes those setting onto the appropriate devices.
