Implements a Ping from this eNMS instance to the selected devices
from inventory, or a custom IP Address, using either ICMP or TCP.

![ICMP / TCP Ping Service](../../_static/automation/service_types/icmp_tcp_ping.png)

Configuration parameters for creating this service instance:

- `Protocol`: Use either ICMP or TCP packets to ping the devices.
- `IP Address`: Custom IP Address to ping or the device's inventory 
    IP Address if empty. (Supports variable substitution)
- `Ports (TCP ping only)`: Which ports to ping (should be formatted as
    a list of ports separated by a comma, for example "22,23,49").
- `Count`: Number of ping packets to send.
- `Timeout`: Seconds to wait before declaring timeout.
- `Ttl`: Time to Live parameter, which tells routers when to discard
    this packet because it has been in the network too long (too many
    hops).
- `Packet Size`: Size of the ping packet payload to send in bytes.
