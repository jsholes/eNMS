This service sends an XML payload to the selected device's netconf interface
using the ncclient Netconf library, which is based on RFC 6241 Netconf.

  using `xml2dict`.

- `Target Config`: Which device configuration to impact.

    - `Running`
    - `Candidate`
    - `Startup`
    
### Copy Config Operation

![Netconf Copy Config](../../_static/automation/service_types/netconf_copyconfig.png)

- `Copy Destination URL`: URL string.

- `Copy Destination`: where to put destination config.

    - `Running`
    - `Candidate`
    - `Startup`
    - `Destination URL`

- `Copy Source`: where to obtain source config.

    - `Running`
    - `Candidate`
    - `Startup`
    - `Source URL`
    
- `Commit`: Commit now? (or make more changes).
 
- `Copy Source URL`: URL string.

- `Convert XML result to dictionary`: converts the Netconf xml response to dict
  using `xml2dict`.

### Dispatch Operation

![Netconf Dispatch](../../_static/automation/service_types/netconf_dispatch.png)

- `XML Filter`: XML content to send as a filter to the device.

- `Convert XML result to dictionary`: Converts the Netconf xml response to dict
  using `xml2dict`.

## Connection Parameters

![Netconf Connection Parameters](../../_static/automation/service_types/netconf_connection_parameters.png)

- `Credentials`: Select between:
    - `Device Credentials`: The application will select the most appropriate credential
      object for each device. If there are multiple credentials available, the 
      `Type of Credential` and `Priority` properties become a tiebreaker.
    - `Named Credentials`: Allows users to reference a specific credential for all targets. Selecting this 
      option requires additional selections below.
    - `Custom Credentials`: Allows users to store a credential against this service. Selecting this 
      option requires additional selections below.
      
!!! Advice

    `Named Credentials` selections will persist through duplicating a service, unlike `Custom Credentials`. 
    [For details on creating a `Named Credential` take a look at this page.](../../administration/credentials.md) 

- `Named Credential`: Select from a list of user created credential objects. 
- `Custom Username`: User provided username, stored against this service.
- `Custom Password`: User provided password, stored against this service.

- `Start New Connection`: **before the service runs**, the current
  cached connection is discarded and a new one is started.
    
- `Connection Name`: If changed to something other than `default`, the
  connection will be cached as a separate connection to that same device.
  This allows for multiple simultaneous "named" connections to a single
  device.
    
- `Close Connection`: once the service is done running, the current
  connection will be closed.
