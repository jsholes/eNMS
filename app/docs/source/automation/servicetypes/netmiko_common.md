These are the Netmiko Common Parameters for all Netmiko Services.

![Netmiko Common Parameters](../../_static/automation/service_types/netmiko_parameters.png)

## Common Netmiko Parameters

-   `Driver`: This selects which Netmiko driver to use when connecting to
    the device. If `Use Device Driver` is checked, the service will use
    the Netmiko driver from the inventory that is associated with the device.
    Otherwise, override and select a particular driver.

!!! Note

    In some cases it is useful to override the driver. One particular example
    is that Napalm Ping is not supported for IOS-XR devices, but the user
    can override the driver to IOS and use the Napalm Ping functionality in
    that driver (ping works the same everywhere; it is not dependent
    on driver functionality).

-   `Enable mode`: If checked, Netmiko should enter enable/privileged
    mode on the device before running the command or applying the
    configuration block. For the Linux driver, this means root/sudo.
-   `Config mode`: If checked, Netmiko should enter config mode.
-   `Fast CLI`: If checked, Netmiko will disable internal wait states and
    delays in order to execute the service as fast as possible.
-   `Timeout`: Netmiko internal timeout in seconds to wait for a
    connection or response before declaring failure.
-   `Delay factor`: Netmiko multiplier used to increase internal delays
    (defaults to 1). Delay factor is used in the send_command Netmiko
    method. See [here for more explanation](https://pynet.twb-tech.com/blog/automation/netmiko-what-is-done.html).
-   `Global delay factor`: Netmiko multiplier used to increase internal
    delays (defaults to 1). Global delay factor affects delays
    beyond Netmiko send_command. Increase this for devices that have
    trouble buffering and responding quickly. Practical max value is 5.

## Connection Parameters

![Netmiko Connection Parameters](../../_static/automation/service_types/netmiko_connection_parameters.png)

- `Credentials`: Select between:
    - `Device Credentials`: The application will select the most appropriate credential
      object for each device. If there are multiple credentials available, the 
      `Type of Credential` and `Priority` properties become a tiebreaker.
    - `Named Credentials`: Allows users to reference a specific credential for all targets. Selecting this 
      option requires additional selections below.
    - `Custom Credentials`: Allows users to store a credential against this service. Selecting this 
      option requires additional selections below.
      
!!! Advice

    `Named Credentials` selections will persist through duplicating a service, unlike `Custom Credentials`. 
    [For details on creating a `Named Credential` take a look at this page.](../../administration/credentials.md) 

- `Named Credential`: Select from a list of user created credential objects. 
- `Custom Username`: User provided username, stored against this service.
- `Custom Password`: User provided password, stored against this service.


- `Start New Connection`: **before the service runs**, the current
  cached connection is discarded and a new one is started.
    
- `Connection Name`: If changed to something other than `default`, the
  connection will be cached as a separate connection to that same device.
  This allows for multiple simultaneous "named" connections to a single
  device.
    
- `Close Connection`: Once the service is done running, the current
  connection will be closed.

## Jump on connect Parameters

Jump on connect is designed to allow a second connection after
connecting to the original device.

![Netmiko Jump On Connect Parameters](../../_static/automation/service_types/netmiko_jumponconnect.png)

-   `Jump to remote device on connect`: If checked, the config items
    below will be used to connect to the secondary device.
-   `Command that jumps to device`: Command to initiate secondary
    connection.
-   `Expected username prompt`: Prompt expected when connecting secondary
    connection.
-   `Device username`: The username to send when the expected username
    prompt is detected.
-   `Expected password prompt`: Prompt expected when connecting secondary
    connection.
-   `Device password`: The password to send when the expected password
    prompt is detected.
-   `Expected prompt after login`: Prompt expected after successfully
    negotiating a connection.
-   `Command to exit device back to original device`: Command required to
    exit the secondary connection.
