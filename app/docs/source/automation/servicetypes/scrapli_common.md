These are the common Scrapli Parameters for Scrapli Commands and Scrapli Data Backup
Services.

## Scrapli Parameters

![Scrapli Common Parameters](../../_static/automation/service_types/scrapli_parameters.png)

- `Driver`: Scrapli driver to use. Currently, it supports:
    - `Device Driver`: Use the driver assigned to the device in the application inventory
    - `arista_eos`
    - `cisco_iosxe`
    - `cisco_iosxr`
    - `cisco_nxos`
    - `juniper_junos`
- `Is Configuration`:  Should the device be put in config mode before
  issuing the commands?
- `Transport`: Supports using the following transport plugins:
    - `system`: Wrapper around OpenSSH/System available SSH binary.
    - `paramiko`: Wrapper around paramiko library.
    - `ssh2`: Wrapper around ssh2-python library.
- `Socket Timeout`: When the socket is created, it is initially set with this timeout.
- `Transport Timeout`: When system transport is selected, this is the timeout used.
If ssh2 or paramiko are selected, the timeouts for each respective library is used.
- `Ops Timeout`: This timeout is used for individual operations (commands).
    
## Connection Parameters

![Scrapli Common Parameters](../../_static/automation/service_types/netmiko_connection_parameters.png)

- `Credentials`: Select between:
    - `Device Credentials`: The application will select the most appropriate credential
      object for each device. If there are multiple credentials available, the 
      `Type of Credential` and `Priority` properties become a tiebreaker.
    - `Named Credentials`: Allows users to reference a specific credential for all targets. Selecting this 
      option requires additional selections below.
    - `Custom Credentials`: Allows users to store a credential against this service. Selecting this 
      option requires additional selections below.
      
!!! Advice

    `Named Credentials` selections will persist through duplicating a service, unlike `Custom Credentials`. 
    [For details on creating a `Named Credential` take a look at this page.](../../administration/credentials.md) 

- `Named Credential`: Select from a list of user created credential objects. 
- `Custom Username`: User provided username, stored against this service.
- `Custom Password`: User provided password, stored against this service.

- `Start New Connection`: **Before the service runs**, the current
  cached connection is discarded and a new one is started.
- `Connection Name`: If changed to something other than `default`, the
  connection will be cached as a separate connection to that same device.
  This allows for multiple simultaneous "named" connections to a single
  device.
- `Close Connection`: Once the service is done running, the current
  connection will be closed.
