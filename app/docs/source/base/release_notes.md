  delete them from the database
- Workers are created when they are detected by the application, ie when a service is run
  by the worker
- Refactor get_workers REST endpoint to use workers in the database instead of storing
  worker data in the redis queue
- When a worker is deleted from the worker table, send SIGTERM signal to underlying process

  - metadata includes export time, export version, and service name in case of service export
  - fix shared workflow import bug (empty list => no way to detect main workflow)
  - in settings.json, add new "import_version" to disallow importing older files (if the
  version in the metadata is not the one from settings.json, the import fails)
- Reduce number of fetch in the scan_folder function to improve performance
- Refactor get_workflow_results to speed up workflow results display
- Refactor get_runtimes to no longer query the result table
- Skip bug fix for run once service (from thread: "Skip query not respected")

  the service is not run.
- Make Result.service_id and Result.parent_runtime indices to speed up results display (filtering/result)
- Add "SETUP_DIR" environment variable to set path to folder where json settings files are located
- Add new "migration" key in setup.json > paths to set path to the folder where migration files
  are located
- Dont update configuration properties if no change detected:
  - Commit: 58798c182c4c61f53b943bb487d16688c225366e
  - in backup service, don't write to local file, don't update value in database and don't
  update "update" timestamp if the value hasn't changed
  - in the "update database configuration from git", dont update the database configuration
    if the "update" timestamp from git is the same as or older than the one stored in the database.
  - Add "force_update" argument to "get git content" and "update database configuration
  from git" functions (when the app runs for the first time, this argument is set to True)
- Add parameterized form properties in dedicated accordion in service edit panel
- Display header and link before results in email notification
- Files Improvements:
  - Refactor the files mechanism to no longer display the full Unix path, only the path
    from the files folder
    - "files" displayed as breadcrumb even if the actual path does not include such a folder
    - the copy to clipboard mechanism still returns the full path so it can be used in e.g python scripts
    - allow both absolute and relative paths in generic and netmiko file transfer services
    - impact on migration: all paths in files must be truncated by removing the path
    to the "files" folder
  - Prevent uploading the same file twice in the file upload panel (or another file
    with the same name)
  - Add trash mechanism for files. Two options:
    - 1) Put trash outside of files folder (not tracked by eNMS). When deleting a file, the database
    object is deleted and the associated unix file is moved to the trash folder, with the current
    time as prefix.
    - 2) Put trash inside the files folder: the same mechanism applies, but the trash folder is
    being tracked by eNMS. Files can be restored (by moving them from the trash folder to another
    directory), and whenever a file in the trash folder is deleted, it is removed (rm) from the
    filesystem. Files are moved to trash via the "update" function so that the file metadata is
    preserved.
    - The path to the trash folder is configured in settings.json > "files" > "trash"
    - The trash folder cannot be deleted from inside the application
    - When a file is moved to the trash, the alert is changed to a warning that says the
    file was moved to the trash folder
    - When importing migration files with "empty database" set to True, or running the mass
    deletion mechanism ("database deletion"), unix files are left untouched.
  - Detect missing files when running scan folder mechanism and mark them as "Not Found"
  - Drag-n-drop the same file multiple times in upload panel no longer possible
  - Use scoped path for playbooks in ansible service (impact on migration files)
- Fix log not sent when add_secret is False or device is None in the get_credentials function bug
- Add new 'prepend_filepath' function in workflow builder namespace to add path to file folder before a string
- Add support for string substitution for the email notification feature (service step 4)
- Limit update all pools mechanism (in pool table and as a service option) to the pools a user
  has "edit" access to

Migration:
- in file.yaml, remove path to "files" folder for all paths
- in service.yaml, compute and add new "read_timeout" property based on fast_cli,
  delay_factor and global_delay_factor
- in service.yaml, ansible playbook services are now used the scoped path to the playbook
  instead of the full path (path to playbook folder + scoped path). The path to the playbook
  folder must be trimmed from all ansible services.

Tests:
- Everything about files is impacted and must be tested again
- Impact of migration import refactoring on migration files import and service import
- Impact of removing payload in workflow results
- Test service form because of Jinja2 Template refactoring
- Test runtimes displayed in WB and logs/results panel (get_runtimes function was refactored)
- Test skip of run once services when all devices are skipped
- Test new trash mechanism for files
- Test ansible playbook service (scoped path instead of full path)

Todo:
- Add context help for custom parameterized form

Version 4.4.0: RBAC and Credentials
-----------------------------------

- Remove settings from UI upper menu (doesn't work with multiple gunicorn workers)
- Add post_update function (60350ede71f6a5146bab9f42a87f7fef0360b98e) after db flush in controller udpate function to compute pool only after the ID has been set, and
  determine what properties to return (e.g not serialized object but only what is needed)
  Return default serialized properties in controller update instead of all serialized relationship for scalability with > 50K devices.
- Refactor freeze edit / run mechanism (pure python check instead of SQL query with originals)
- New Bulk Edit option for appending / removing to a multiple instance list (dropdown list on the right of the field).
- Add regression tests for get_connection global variable
- New defaultRbac mechanism to set rbac value of filtering function. In the
  configuration table, the default RBAC mode is set to "configuration".
- Use tableOrdering function when initializing a table instead of redrawing table
  after initialization, to avoid calling draw function twice when loading a table.
  Commit: 7d8999d0fc4ac7a6a7fd49e3275fdca4ac12ade3
- Added "last_modified_by" property to store name of user who last modified
  service/object/pool
  Mail: "new feature request (minor)"
  Commit: 0e0d90aeac5f5a977e6a452946794cd1293621ed
- Added mechanism to update last_modified property of a workflow whenever there
  is any change to an (sub)edge or a (sub)service.
  Cases when the last modified property is updated:
  - the workflow itself is updated
  - any service or subservice is updated (ie including subworkflows)
  - copy service in workflow is used in workflow or subworkflows
  - add edge in workflow or subworkflows
  - any deletion is made in workflow or subworkflows
  - any service is skipped in workflow or subworkflows
- Same last_modified(_by) mechanism for devices, links and pools.

- Refactor get function to fix scalability issues:
  - The properties sent to the front-end are defined in properties.json > "panel"
  - Remove get_all controller endpoint (unused)
  - Remove get_properties controller endpoint (replaced by get with "properties_only" keyword)
- In task form validation (#267):
  - Forbid end date to be equal or anterior to start date.
  - Forbid frequency to be 0 when a task has an end date (= is periodic)
- Fix URL encoding for links to workflow builder with runtime (encode space to %20) (#278)
- Add Clear Search button in file table
- Use SQL Alchemy `regexp_match` mechanism (new from 1.4, replaced eNMS custom per DB regex match mechanism)
  Link: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/sqlelement.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.ColumnOperators.regexp_match
  Commit: a6af8a88f197b891928986dd492ce2ff39fc629a
- Add "creator" properties in all edit panels
- Fix link to workflow / network set to None after creating new or duplicating existing
  instance (via post_update mechanism)
- Fix asynchronous bug in netmiko services: wrong disabled status after opening
  edit panel to a service in netmiko "Expect String" field.
- Fix bug where RBAC Edit access is needed to run a service
  Thread: "Edit Service/Device Needed for user using /rest/run_service"
- Remove "settings" from global variables so that it cannot be overridden.
  Thread: "Settings and security question"
- Enable migration for files and folders.
- When selection in builder changed, close deletion panel (wrong node / edge count)
  Issue #280 / Commit 6fc007f6a1d43fd2b61652f02983dba0cedef68a
- Resize table headers when the panel that contains the table is resized
  Commit 40a909673f4b9cfbfcae58fb60e86f6e6bd83994
- When a file is deleted, mark as missing instead of deleting associate file object
- Make "update device RBAC" pool mechanism accessible from REST API.
- Fix bug where using run_service REST endpoint with non existing device returns 403
  not allowed error instead of more specific "Device not found" error
- Add new "Credential Object" mechanism in connection services, REST service and
  generic file transfer service. Choose credential object explicitly instead of using
  custom username / password.
- Report feature
  - Report template can use python substitution or Jinja 2
  - Report output can be either text-based or HTML
  - Option to display the report when the run is over instead of the service results.
  - Option to send report as part of the email notification
  - Report can be used for any services in a workflow, not just the workflow itself.
  - In get_result, new "all_matches" keyword to get all results.
  - New "files" / "reports" folder to store predefined templates that are used to
    populate the "report" field in the service edit panel.
  - Add new "get_all_results" function in the global variables
- Add support for distributed task queue for automation with Dramatiq.
- Return an error in the UI if the commit of workflow logs, report or result
  fails (e.g data too long db error because of payload data for the results),
  don't commit if the size of the data is higher than the maximum column size
  configured in database.json, and emit warning if it is than 50%
- Fix "List index out of range" bug in Jump on Connect mechanism
  Commit 457f46dd2c496757e924d922f3455626d35a3784
- Add RBAC support to credentials
- Fix Netmiko exit_config_mode bug (to be called after commit)
- Add new "log_events" key under settings.json > files to control whether file changes
  must be logged as unix log and changelog.
- Add new "Disable Workflow" feature:
  - New property "Disabled" in service form to disable a workflow
  - When a service / workflow is disabled, it cannot be run from the UI or the REST API
  - New property "Disabled Time & User": if the workflow is disabled, indicates when the
  service was disabled and by whom; empty otherwise.

RBAC Refactoring:
- Service export: owners and RBAC read / edit / etc are exported in the service
  .yaml file. If the importing user doesn't have access to the service based on
  how RBAC is set up, the service will not be visible after export.

Migration:
- The credential file must be updated to use groups instead of pools
  ("user_pools" -> "groups"). The appropriate groups must be created first.
- In migration files, check that the "settings" variable isn't used in
  any workflow. If the server IP, name or URL is used, the "server" variable
  should be used instead.
- "get_all" and "get_properties" controller functions have been removed.
  Check that they are not used anywhere in custom code (plugin, custom.py, etc)

Test (besides what is in release notes):
- the notification mechanism hasn't been impacted (in particular notification header
  option + devices results)
- Jump on connect mechanism
- RBAC
  - new mechanism
  - Freeze Edit / Run mechanism (refactored)

Version 4.3.0
-------------

- Define Server IP address and URL with the `SERVER_ADDR` (default `0.0.0.0`) and `SERVER_URL` (default `http://192.168.56.102`) environment variable instead of `settings.json` / `app` section (as VM
  settings, they don't belong in the application settings and shouldn't be checked in the code).
- Add new "server" variable in workflow global space set to a dictionary that contains server name,
  IP address and URL.
- Make "Results as List" False by default for scrapli (not useful when only
  one command, which is most of the time).
- For consistency with Scrapli
  * Rename "Netmiko Validation" to "Netmiko Commands"
  * Allow sending multiple commands via Netmiko Commands
  * Add "Results as List" to Netmiko Commands 
- Add "use genie" option in netmiko commands service for Genie / PyATS support
- Add Jinja2 template support for netmiko and scrapli commands field (iteration no longer required for loops).
- Add new `default_function` (sqlalchemy parameter) and `render_kw` (wtforms parameters) for custom fields in properties.json.

  * Add new option to parse TextFSM as JSON object
  * Add new option to support Jinja2 Template conversion
  * Add new option to support Template Text Parser conversion
- Fix bulk deletion and bulk removal from a filtered table (e.g dashboard bulk deletion deletes everything,
  not just the objects displayed in the table).
- New feature to align nodes in Network Builder and Workflow Builder:
  - Horizontal and vertical alignment
  - Horizontal and vertical distribution
- Make all objects in object select list (both single and multiple entries) hyperlink to the edit panel.
- Make all results in the Results table link to the workflow builder.
- Make it possible to share link to a specific workflow / runtime (optional) to the workflow builder,
  with the following syntax: workflow_builder/{workflow_id}/{runtime}.
- Add "shared" property to the service table.
- Add shared subworkflow to the list of top-level workflows in the workflow builder to provide
  the ability to view all runtimes (including when it was run as standalone workflow).
- Remove "Approved by admin" mechanism for Unix Command Service. Instead, check if the new command is
  different from the old command: if it is and the user is not an admin, an error is raised.
- Remove backward / forward mechanism in the network and service table. Make networks / workflows links to
  the network / workflow builder for consistency with results page.
- Add User Profile window to change username, password, user email, etc.
- Add User landing page to decide which page to display after logging in (editable in profile).
  Default landing page is configurable from settings.json > authentication > landing_page.
- Add mechanism to show a single device status in workflow builder UI (logs filtering + service display)
- Add mechanism to search for a string across all services of a workflow in the workflow builder, and
  across all nodes in the network builder.
- Fix vertical alignment in all tables (cell content was not centered on y axis because of buttons height in
  the last column).
- Add export service button in Workflow Builder.
- New Files Management System:
  * defined via settings / paths / files (default: eNMS / files folder)
  * files are automatically scanned when starting the application, and can be rescanned via the UI
  * files have a "Status" property showing the last action (updated, moved, deleted, etc)
  * last_modified is the unix last modified timestamp
  * files can be displayed hierarchically or flat in the table (default: hierarchical display)
  * both files and folder can be exported to browser; folders are compressed as tgz before export
  * new files can be uploaded to any folder from the UI
  * deleting a file or folder in eNMS will delete it locally
  * a folder can be created in currently displayed folder, not a file because a file must be
    associated with a local file.
  * watchdog is used to keep track of all files change done outside of the app
- redis config in settings.json moved to the inner key "redis" > "config
- redis new option in settings.json > "redis" > "flush_on_restart": flush redis queue when the app restarts.
- Remove check box for "use device driver" add "use device driver" into drop down and make this the default.
- Add get_connection function in global variables to access connection object from a python snippet service.
  A non-default connection can be retrieved from the cache by passing the keyword argument "name".
- Support custom ip address in ping service (new IP address field, defaults to device IP if empty).
- Add new "mandatory" keyword in custom properties to make the field required to submit the form.
- Add new "allow_password_change" keyword in settings > authentication to configure whether the user
  profile lets users change their own password (if `false`, the password field is not shown)
- Add new "force_authentication_method" to force users to log in with the authentication method saved in
  the database (e.g first authentication method used)
- Add new 'Man Minutes' feature to compute time saved per workflow
  * Only for top-level workflows
  * Man Minutes can be defined per device or for the whole workflow
  * Per Device is only allowed if the workflow run method is DxD or SxS with workflow targets
  * The workflow must be a success (or per device success) to be counted in the total man minutes
  * Man Minutes can be made mandatory via 'mandatory_man_minutes' key in automation.json > workflow
- Remove unused parent and parent_device relationship on the Run class.
- Import Services:
  * The timeout for the Import_services endpoint is configurable in "automation.json" under
    the "service_import" > "timeout" property. Logging on timeout is also improved.
  * The "stem" of the imported file (e.g., service.tgz) does not have to exactly match the
    directory in the .tgz file (i.e., "serviceA_v1.tgz" with "serviceA/service.yaml" is supported).
- The napalm ping service separated the `ping_timeout` from the napalm `timeout`.
- Add new settings "max_content_length" in settings.json > "app" (Flask parameter)
- Add new timeout setting for file import in settings.json > "files"

Version 4.2.0
-------------

- Add Network builder mechanism
- Add 3D visualization of network devices
- Extend Devices and Links with subclass / custom properties and a separate tab in the UI, the same way services work.
- Remove deep_services function used for export, use service.children relationship instead.
- Dont subclass SQLAlchemy Column following advice of SQLAlchemy creator.
- Make corrupted edges deletion mechanism a troublehooting snippet instead of a button in the admin panel.
- Move redis configuration in settings.json > "redis" key
- Add new mechanism to limit results in server-side drop-down list with filtering constraints.
- Limit superworkflow selection to workflows that contains the shared Placeholder service.
- Set trigger variable to "Regular Run" or "Parameterized Run" when service is triggered from the UI instead of "UI".
- Add SSH Proxy mechanism (multiple jump server in gateways property, gateway device subtype, priority
  tie-break mechanism)
- Consider runtime limiting user / all toggle mechanism in the restart service window.
- Move doc link to settings.json to allow custom doc links for plugins. Generate doc link in the jinja2 template
  instead of javascript (otherwise, wrong doc link until updated in js)
- Move tables refresh rate to settings.json to allow for custom refresh rates.
- New "Category" property / mechanism for the drop-down list of the site and workflow builder.
- Reinstate service selection with single left click (Ctrl no longer needed)
- Remove pytest, coverage, and travis dependencies.
- Reinstate single left click for node selection in workflow & site builder.
- Remove most union subquery in rbac_filter because a union of query yields a CompoundSelect
  SQLAlchemy object, and this is not compatible with using with_entites (via filtering properties kw).
- Fix export in bulk (the hierarchical display mode was not considered, all services inside a workflow
  were exported even when "hierarchical display" was selected)
- Add notification banner mechanism
- Remove default_access property, replace with "admin_only" boolean. Impact on migration.
- Make "run_service" rest api endpoint default to async True
- Update netmiko and napalm Backup services to load deferred row before updating. Impact on both services.
- Remove pathlib from requirements.txt
- Update workflow algorithm to not add services to priority queue in DxD mode if all are discarded.
- Update Ansible Service to use custom path in cwd argument of subprocess.check_output.
- Change default priority to 10 for services. Update of migration files required.
- Add new check box "Approved by an Admin user" in the Unix Command service. That box must be ticked by
  an admin user for the service to be allowed to run. A non-admin user cannot save a service if it is
  ticked, meaning that each time a Unix Command service is edited, it must be re-appproved.
- Add new timeout parameters for Scrapli service
- Always show security logs, even when logging is disabled. Add "allow_disable" (default: True) keyword argument
  to log function to prevent logs from being disabled if necessary.
- Add new 'deactivate_rbac_on_read' property in rbac.json, under 'advanced' key. Set to true by default.
  When true, eNMS no longer applies rbac for reading from the database. (=> better performances)
- Make the vendor, operating_system and model properties a custom list for devices, links and services,
  and category for sites and workflows. The drop-down list choices can be configured in properties.json > property_list key.
- Add support for renaming objects from the REST API (with key "new_name")
- Add limit to maximum number of nodes that can be displayed in site builder". Configurable via
  visualization.json > Network Builder > max_allowed_nodes
- Add new option to display site nodes as ellipses instead of images for better performances. Configurable via
  visualization.json > Network Builder > display_nodes_as_images
- Auto-update Vendor and Operating System property value of a new service in the workflow builder
  based on the values of these properties in the parent workflow.
- Add support for custom ordering in plugin tables (configurable by overriding the tableOrdering function in the
  table JS class)
- Add support for using device credentials in the Rest Call Service (impact on migration files:
  "username" / "password" => "custom_username" / "custom_password"). Don't allow using device credentials
  if the run method is set to "Run Once".
- Make webssh command configurable from settings / ssh section
- Add new label size property to configure label size in workflow and network builder

- Refactor the geographical and Logical View to behave like the workflow builder:

  - List of all pools that contain at least one device or link, stored in user browser local storage
  - Remove default pool mechanism. Remove "visualization_default" property in pool model. By design, the default pool becomes the first pool in alphabetical order
  - Add backward / forward control like the workflow builder

- Rename "monitor_requests" function to "process_requests": impact on plugins
- Add global "factory" and "delete" functions in the workflow builder to create and delete new objects
  from a workflow.

  execute for all accessible devices and fail for the inaccessible devices instead of failing the entire workflow.
- app.service_db was renamed to "service_run_count" and it no longer has an inner "runs" key: the gunicorn
  auto safe restart code that uses it must be updated accordingly.
- Store and commit web SSH session content in backend instead of relying on send beacon mechanism and
  onbeforeunload callback so that the saving of a session does not depend on user behavior
- Refactoring of the forms: all forms are now in eNMS.forms.py. Impact on form import:

  same workflow
- Add new "get_credential" global variable in workflow builder. Used to get a password or a passphrase
  for a netmiko validaiton command or rest call service. For obfuscation purposes.

- Improve display of Json property in form (make them collapsed by default)
- Update to new version of Vis.Js (potential workflow builder impact)
- Add mechanism to save only failed results (e.g for config collection workflow)
- New database.json to define engine parameters, import / export properties, many to many relationship, etc.
- Fork based on string value instead of just True / False: new discard mode for the skip mechanism. When using discard, devices do not follow any edge after the skipped service.
- Refactor skip property so that it is no longer a property of the service to avoid side effect of skipping shared services.
- Add new option in pool to invert logic for each property.
- New Option "Update pools after running" for workflow like the configuration management workflow.

  the configuration table.
- Add ability to hard-code logic to mask password hashes when config is displayed in custom controller.
- Add workflow tree in the workflow builder to visualize workflow and subworkflows as a tree with buttons:
  edit / new mechanism: highlight to teleport to any service. Makes it easier to work with large multi-level workflows.
- Replace gotty with pure python implementation. Save session output with webssh. Need to set ENMS_USER and ENMS_PASSWORD
  like with the scheduler to save the session via REST API. For this to work, admin credentials must be defined via
  two new environment variables: ENMS_USER and ENMS_PASSWORD (same as scheduler)
- Fix bug connection not cached when using iteration values with a standalone service
- Fix bug when exporting table to .csv - column shift if comma in property value
- When scheduling a task, the creator of the service run is not properly set to the user who scheduled
  the task instead of the admin user.

  - Remove "group" table (a group is a pool of users)
  - Add "groups" property to user and add "creator" property for pools, devices and links.

- New Credentials mechanism:

  - Credentials can be either username / password or SSH key. Both passwords and SSH key are stored in the Vault (no key file stored on the unix server).
  - Credentials also have an "Enable Password" field to go to enable mode after logging in.
  - Credentials have a priority field; credential object with higher priority is used if multiple available credentials.
  - Credentials have two pools: user pool to define which users can use the credentials, and device pools to define which
    devices the credential can be used for.
  - User "groups" property is now a field. This field can be used to define user pools. Services have the same "groups" property.
    When creating a new service, the groups field will be automatically set to the user groups. This allows services to be automatically
    added to the appropriate pool of services, if the pool of services is defined based on that group property.
  - Credentials can be either "Read - Write" (default) or "Read only". In a top-level service, new "credential type" field
    to choose between "Any", "Read-only" and "Read-write" in order to define which credentials should be used when running
    the service.
