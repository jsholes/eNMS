  <p><b>Multiprocessing</b> allows work for multiple devices to run concurrently.</p>
  <p>
    Use the checkbox to enable/disable multiprocessing for a service or workflow. The
    <b>Maximum Number of Processes</b> field specified the limit of how many devices can
    run concurrently. Higher concurrency makes sense for operations that spend a lot of
    time waiting for data from devices, lower concurrency for compute focused
    activities. Actual performance varies based on other activities running on the same
    system.

  <strong>Contexts where multiprocessing might add value</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Services in a service by service workflow or subworkflow</li>
    <li>Device by device workflows and sub-workflows</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Contexts where multiprocessing does not add value</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Service by service workflows</li>
    <li>Services or sub-workflows within a device by device workflow</li>
  </ul>
