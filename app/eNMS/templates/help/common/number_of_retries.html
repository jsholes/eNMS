      <b>Number of retries</b> specifies the number of additioanl times to run the
      service after it completes with <b>Failure</b> result.

      Tip: Retries can work along with the <b>Validation</b> section of <b>Step 4</b> to
      create an active polling loop. For example, imagine the case where running a slow
      asynchronous commandX on a device, the device raises an alarm until commandX
      completes, and once completed, the alarm clears. If the workflow wait until
      commandX is complete, this can be accomplished with 2 services: a) service 1
      issues commandX, b) service 2 issues a command to show alarms with <b>Step 4</b>
      <b>Validation</b> set to text match the Alarm Text -and- with
      <b>Negative Logic</b> enabled -and- <b>Number of retries</b> set to a high number.
      This will cause service 2 to fail and retry showing alarms until the alarm clears,
      indicating that commandX is complete. Then the workflow will continue.
