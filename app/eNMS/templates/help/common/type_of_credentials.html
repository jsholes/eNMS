    <b>Type of Credentials</b> allows you to select the type of device credentials to
    use for a connection which can be <b>Any</b>, <b>Read Write</b> or <b>Read Only</b>.
    This selection does not override Role Based Access rules. However, if for a given
    device, a user has access to multiple credentials of type <b>Read Write</b> and
    <b>Read Only</b>, this option allows the service author to specify which type of
    credential to use for the connection.
